I designed my web portfolio in the UX Design class using Adobe XD. Before designing, I had to create a few steps like a creative brief, Mind Map, Mood board, Ideation, Low-Fidelity Wireframe, High Digital fidelity wireframe, etc. Then I used HTML, CSS, and bootstrap to code the whole website.
There were a few difficulties while developing this code. They are:
1. The 'carousel-caption' on the home page was a bit challenging as it was not being responsive for all screens compared to others. So I have decided to create multiple media queries just to make it responsive and it seems to work well now.
2. It was time-consuming to get the perfect thumbnails that I wanted on the portfolio page, at first I was confused between using cards or thumbnails, after trying both, the thumbnail was the best option for my theme. I made changes both in the HTML and CSS to create it.
3. Most challenging was creating a gallery of images with a hover effect on the services page. I used grid on each image to display like a gallery. To maintain the texts and buttons on each image with a hover effect I used flex on CSS to keep the consistency well for all the screens. Similar way, I used flex for buttons to appear along with hover when the cursor is on the image for the box section on the services page. Moreover, I was facing a problem with the image size as it was collapsing with each other when being responsive due to which I have used width in percentage rather in pixels.
4. Another difficult part was to achieve the layout of the desktop view on the contact page. It was frustrating when my sections were not dividing into 2 columns on that page. Then I have used flex for form, table, and circle image to be in 2 columns. I used grid for location and contact-details to be in 2 columns.
Creating this portfolio has helped me to learn and accomplish new developments in web design. I believe a bootstrap is a great tool and convenient to create websites. Also, this website maintains consistency of texts, theme, color, and many more which I struggled in my previous assignments. 
List of assets or resources:

5. Used three pictures of my friends which I captured using my camera on the contact page for circle images.
6. Downloaded fonts from https://fonts.google.com/ and used @font-face to import font-family.
7. Obtained all icons from https://fontawesome.com/icons?from=io.
